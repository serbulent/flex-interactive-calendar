			"1. What am I looking at?\n" + 
			"  This is a sample Calendar component I've been playing around with.\n\n" + 
			"2. Cool! Is this the one Adobe Consulting is building?\n" + 
			"  Nope. They're building a scheduling component, and will be much more full featured than this.  This one is buggy, and more of a proof of concept I've been working on." + 
			"  But worth checking out for some inspiration. At least to tide you over until they release theirs :).\n\n" + 
			"3. I don't see any data!\n" + 
			"  Yeah, the server's a little slow. Just be patient.\n\n" + 
			"4. Cool, now I see data. What can I do?" + 
			"  Here are some things to try:\n" + 
			"  - click the left and right arrows at the top right.\n" + 
			"  - click the month/year/day buttons to change the view.\n" + 
			"  - click on the small calendar to go right to a day.\n" + 
			"  - now shift click on a different day on the small calendar to select a range\n" + 
			"  - try selecting large and small ranges...2 days, 2 weeks, etc.\n" + 
			"  - in the month view, click and drag an event to move it from day to day\n" + 
			"  - in the day view, click and drag an event to change its duration or start time\n" + 
			"  - in month view, you can click on a day (not an event...the day background) to zoom to that day." + 
			"\n\n" + 
			"5. Cool. How do I load more data?\n" + 
			"  click the 'add calendar' button under the 'default' legend on the left.\n\n" + 
			"6. What can I load?\n" + 
			"  There's two default calendars to choose from. Make sure to pick a color, and enter a name.\n\n" + 
			"7. Is that it?\n" + 
			"  Well, it's loading ics files, so in theory you could put in any ics url (i.e., a google calendar). But the ics parsing is " + 
			"  really rudimentary...just enough to get some data in I could work with...so don't hold your breath.\n\n" + 
			"8. Hey! I found a bug!\n" + 
			"   I certainly hope so! If you didn't, you probably weren't using it at all. Like I said, it's a proof of concept.\n\n" + 
			"9. Cool. Can I use this?\n" + 
			"   By all means.  I'll be posting the code in a little while.\n\n" + 
			"10. I really want this, but it's too buggy!\n" +
			"   I've got to get back to actually working on the SDK...so I'm looking for someone (or someones) to take over this code.  Are you volunteering?";

			"2007/02/25 Update:\n\n" +
			
			"New Features:\n" +

			"  1. Now we can Add events to the calendar by select the Date/Time area like Outlook.\n" +
			
			"  2. Also double click the event to Edit/Delete the event.\n" +
			
			"  3. Enable setting different colors to the event (although the ics format maybe doesn\'t support this color).\n" +
			
			"  4. The event now has a new field of description.\n" +
			
			"  5. Update the event ToolTip with my HtmlToolTip component, refer to this article <a href='http://www.flex-flex.net/blog/article.asp?id=18' target='_blank'><U>Enable the ToolTip to support HTML</U></a>.\n\n" +
			
			
			"Fix Bugs:\n" +
			
			"  1. Calendar date is not correct when user is on some day like \"Dec 31\", refer to my previous article <a href='http://www.flex-flex.net/blog/article.asp?id=30' target='_blank'><U>Carefully set the year/month/date of Date</U></a>.\n" +
			
			"  2. When user selects some dates whose ranger is not a whole week or month (eg. select three dates on the DataChooser by Click with Shift Key), then click \"&gt;&gt;\" button to Next, and click \"&lt;&lt;\" to previous, it will cause error.\n" +
			
			"  3. When user clicks one \"Sunday\" (eg. Sun Sep 17 2006), it will be \"Day View\", then clicks \"week\" button, the calendar will show nothing.\n" +
			
			"  4. When \"Day View\", then time grid and the event box don\'t support mouse wheel to up and down.\n\n\n" +
