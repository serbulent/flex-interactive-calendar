This calendar component is great. It’s still has some bugs in it, but it’s my favorite Flex calendar component out there.

It was originally developed by Ely Greenfield and some bug fixes and enhancements were made by Jove Shi.

Since both Jove site is offline there is no other copy in project format.

I also will make some small commits to project. Since I use Flex 4.5 I couldn't said anything for older versions to if project will properly run or not.
